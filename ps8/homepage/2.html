            I love playing basketball, and my favorite basketball player is
            <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1789424781093118386"> Kyrie Irving </a>.
            Yes, actually, I gave myself, Irving, this English name because Kyrie Irving.
            <br>
            I love his dancing on the basketball court, his glamorous and efficient endings on the basketball court.

          Programming
          <br>
          I kind of like programming, especially when I use codes to do something, make a game, manipulate the data, or make my own web.
          It is the process of creation that really appeals to me.
