If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

I would calculate the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person's top 100 songs from the past year, and then,
assign different weights to different average, for example: energy 20%, valence 30%, and danceability 50%, then,
get a final number, which determines the audio aura in the past year.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

More flexibility, and some average. No better way, I suppose.
